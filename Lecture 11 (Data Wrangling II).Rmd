# Loading data from the WEB...NON-SELECTOR-GADGET
```{r}
url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"
drug_use_xml = read_html(url)

drug_use_xml

```

# Table-tag (if you see tables on a website)
```{r}
drug_use_xml %>% 
  html_nodes(css = "table")

# Pulling out the 15 tables included on the webpage.

table_marj = 
  (drug_use_xml %>%  html_nodes(css="table")) %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  as_tibble()

table_marj
```
The double square brackets indicates the # table you want to extract from the "tables" from the website.


## Practice Problem
```{r}
url = "https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/new_york/new_york"
cost_of_living_xml = read_html(url)

cost_of_living_xml

cost_of_living_xml %>% 
    html_nodes(css="table")

cost_of_living = 
  (cost_of_living_xml %>%  html_nodes(css="table")) %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% 
  html_table(header=TRUE)


# ALTERNATIVE WAY!!
nyc_cost = 
  read_html("https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/new_york/new_york") %>%
  html_nodes(css = "table") %>%
  .[[1]] %>%
  html_table(header = TRUE)
```
